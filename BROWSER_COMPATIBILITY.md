# BlockNSFW Browser Compatibility

BlockNSFW ships as Manifest V3 extension for Chromium browsers and Firefox.

## Supported Browsers

### Primary targets

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 109+

### Expected to work

- Microsoft Edge
- Brave
- Opera
- Vivaldi
- Chromium
- Other Chromium-based browsers with MV3 support

### Not supported

- Safari

## Repo Layout by Browser

- `manifest.json` - Chrome / Chromium build
- `manifest.firefox.json` - Firefox build
- `scripts/build-extension.mjs` - packages both browser targets cross-platform
- `build-chrome.ps1` / `build-firefox.ps1` - PowerShell compatibility wrappers

Firefox is not separate MV2 port. It uses dedicated MV3 manifest plus same runtime files.

## Key Compatibility Notes

- Runtime code uses `const browserAPI = typeof browser !== 'undefined' ? browser : chrome;` to bridge Chrome / Firefox APIs.
- Chrome build uses `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess`.
- Firefox build uses `declarativeNetRequest`.
- Firefox build uses `background.scripts`, while Chrome build uses service-worker entry in `manifest.json`.
- Extension pages are referenced through `runtime.getURL(...)`, which keeps popup/options/audit/stats pages portable across browsers.

## Build Commands

The Node.js 18+ build commands work on Linux, macOS, and Windows:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build:chrome
npm run build:firefox
npm run build:zip
```

## Firefox Notes

- Dev manifest currently uses placeholder Gecko ID `blocknsfw@extension.local`.
- For AMO release builds, replace with final signed-distribution ID if required by release workflow.
- Temporary install path for testing: `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
